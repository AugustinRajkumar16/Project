ESOPHAGEAL CANCER DATASET

    Automatic detection of diseases with the use of computers is essential, but is unexplored because of the low research interest in this field.Such improvements may improve 
    scientific practice and refine health care systems everywhere in the world. However, datasets containing medical images are infrequently available,making reproducibility and 
    assessment of approaches almost impossible. Kvasir dataset containing images from the gastrointestinal tract. The quantity of images is enough to use for extraordinary 
    responsibilities such as image retrieval, machine learning, deep learning and transfer learning. The dataset consists of the images with distinct resolution from 720x576 
    up-to 1920x1072 pixels. The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) dataset is a collection of various cancer datasets along with different patient
    images. The dataset is composed of total 100 images with resolution of 1600Ã—1200 gathered from 39 patients. The images are divided into 50 images without any cancer signs 
    obtained from 17 patients and the other 50 with cancerous regions from 22 patients diagnosed with EAC.
