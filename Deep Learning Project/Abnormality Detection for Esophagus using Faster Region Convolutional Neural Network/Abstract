cases were filed globally in 2012, accounting 3% of all new cases of cancer. It is the sixth most common cause of death from cancer. Now-a-days, almost all patients are 
pretentious by cancer in global level. Therefore detecting esophageal cancer during initial stages, will stop the development of disease into human cells. During esophagus 
observation, if there is any abnormalities then it will be very much complicated in near future.

     Therefore, initial observation and timely detection is required due to the irregular form, variable size, and the complicated surrounding vicinity which requires a significant 
effort and practices. In this work, Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network (Faster RCNN) is used to find out anomalous area from endoscopic images which is the best way to 
detect it. For the feature extraction purpose Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) is used and is also aggregated along with Gabor features with the Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) features. 

      This is to deal with challenges of getting the abnormally complex areas features. So, concatenation of both DenseNet and Gabor will improve texture information at
the detection point. Experimental results on Faster RCNN will give detecting anomalies in endoscopic images, excluding noise data, without any human intervention and errors. 
Regarding the Kvasir datasets, the results show an outstanding performance with a recall of 94.7% and a precision of 83.7% with a mean of average precision of 72.1%, which is a 
good performance compared to the rest of the alternative detection methods
