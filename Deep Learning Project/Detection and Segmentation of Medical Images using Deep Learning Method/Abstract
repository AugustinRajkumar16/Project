 The overall objective of this project is to detect Colorectal Cancer cells in gastrointestinal portion. As generation changes, the cancer mortality rate keeps on increasing
in global level. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer deaths in worldwide. Around 1,47,950 cases were filed globally in 2020, accounting 3% of all new cases of 
cancer. Therefore, detecting colorectal cancer during initial stages, will stop the development of disease into human cells. During colorectal polyps observation, if there is any 
abnormalities then it will be very much complicated in near future. Therefore, initial observation of colonoscopy is common way to detect colorectal polyps and timely detection is
required due to the irregular form, variable size, and the complicated surrounding vicinity which requires a significant effort and practices. 

      The presented system is based on two models of detection and segmentation. First model is Active Contour segmentation. It is based on energy minimization for masking location
of polyps with several iterations to detected and segmented affected part. While the second model, the powerful object detection neural network is Mask Region Convolutional Neural 
Network (Mask RCNN) to identify and segment polyps in the colonoscopy images. 

      Both the models are showing good outcomes with better results. Regarding the Active Contour Model, the results show an outstanding performance with a recall of 81.2% and a 
precision of 71.2% with average precision (AP) of 52.6%. While for the Mask RCNN, the model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art performance with 82.2% recall and 82.4% 
precision with AP value of 91.1%. The experimental results demonstrate that the system is able to detect and segment polyps in colonoscopy images.
